FitnessTracker
==============

A simple little android application which demonstrates how to intermingle some of today's most interesting technologies in the Android ecosystem: Dagger, Otto, android-priority-jobqueue, gradle, lightORM and some calabash tests. All wrapped up in a neat MVC pattern. Nothing fancy, but probably useful for everyone trying to use more than one of those frameworks/tools together.
